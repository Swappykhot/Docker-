## 🚀 Getting started with Docker?

Here’s a visual guide that covers the **Docker container lifecycle**, **image build flow**, and a comparison between **Docker and Virtual Machines**.

### 🧱 How it Works

#### 🔹 Docker Container Lifecycle
- Start with an **Image**
- Run it as a **Container**
- Stop it when done = **Stopped Container**

#### 🔹 Docker Image Build Flow
1. Write a `Dockerfile`
2. Build it → gets converted to an **Image**
3. Run that image → becomes a **Container**

#### 🔹 Docker vs Virtual Machines
Docker is lightweight and shares the host OS, while VMs require full **Guest OS + Hypervisor**, making Docker faster and more efficient for modern DevOps.
